Google is an American multinational corporation specializing in Internet-related services and products.
These include search, cloud computing, software, and online advertising technologies.
[6] Most of its profits are derived from AdWords.[7][8]

Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D.
students at Stanford University.
Together they own about 16 percent of its shares.
They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998.
An initial public offering followed on August 19, 2004.
Its mission statement from the outset was "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible
and useful",[9] and its unofficial slogan was "Don't be evil".
